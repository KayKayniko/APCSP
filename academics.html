	<p>My school year had many ups and downs, for example:<br><br/>
	In the first semester, I got a lot bad grades on my chemistry tests, and I was really upset. However, during the second semester, my grades have started to get better. I also had so many more tests this school year compared to last school year, and the year feels so much longer. However, I have lots of fun chatting with my friends in english calss so its ok.</p>
